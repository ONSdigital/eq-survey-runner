        description: "A library of standard electronic XML business documents such as purchase orders and invoices.\
         \ UBL is designed to plug directly into existing business, legal, auditing, and records management practices.\
         \ It is designed to eliminate the re-keying of data in existing fax- and paper-based business correspondence\
         \ and provide an entry point into electronic commerce for small and medium-sized businesses."
      - title: XML (Extensible Markup Language)
        description: "A markup language (mechanism to identify structures) for documents containing structured\
         \ information. Structured information contains both content (words, pictures, etc.) \
         \ and some indication of what role that content plays (for example, content in a section heading has\
         \ a different meaning from content in a footnote, which means something different to content in\
         \ a figure caption or content in a database table, etc.)."
