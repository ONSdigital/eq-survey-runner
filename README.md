## Run with Docker
Install Docker for your system: https://www.docker.com/

To get eq-survey-runner running the following command will build and run the containers
```
docker-compose up -d
```

When the containers are running you are able to access the application as normal, and code changes will be reflected in the running application.
However, any new dependencies that are added would require a re-build.

To rebuild the eq-survey-runner container, the following command can be used.
```
docker-compose build
```

If you need to rebuild the container from scratch to re-load any dependencies then you can run the following
```
docker-compose build --no-cache
```

To run just the unit tests inside Docker:
```
docker build -t onsdigital/eq-survey-runner .
docker build -t onsdigital/eq-survey-runner-unit-tests -f Dockerfile.test .
docker run onsdigital/eq-survey-runner-unit-tests
```


## Pre-Requisites
In order to run locally you'll need PostgreSQL and Node.js installed

PostgreSQL
```
brew install postgres
```

npm
```
brew install npm
```

Note that npm currently requires Python 2.x for some of the setup steps,
it doesn't work with Python 3.

## Setup
It is preferable to use the version of Python locally that matches that
used on deployment. This project has a `.python_version` file for this
purpose.

If you are using pyenv (https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv), you can install
the correct version of Python alongside any existing versions easily:

```
pyenv install
```

You should also use a virtualenv (https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv-virtualenv)
to keep this project's package installations separate from others you
are working on, to create a new virtualenv:

```
pyenv virtualenv <your env name>
pyenv activate <your env name>
```

Upgrade pip and install dependencies:

```
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e git+https://github.com/ONSdigital/cryptography.git@4a90c254278231d7defeac304a3cfd752e96e786#egg=cryptography
```

You may need to point the build on a mac if you have problems building OpenSSL. See [here](https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/2692) for more details.

```
export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib"
export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include"
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib/pkgconfig"
```

If you need to run the tests:
```
pip install -r requirements_for_test.txt
```

Run the server with

```
./scripts/run_app.sh

```

This will generate a JWT for you to log into the application. The script prints out the URL with the token included.

### Front-end Toolkit

The front-end toolkit uses nodejs, yarn and gulp.

Install yarn with:

```
npm install yarn --global
```

Compile the project with
```
yarn compile
```

There are a few additional npm tasks:

Command                                    | Task
-------------------------------------------|----------------------
`yarn compile`                          | Build the assets (js, css, img) into `/static`
`yarn dev`                              | Build assets and watch for changes. Runs Browsersync.
`yarn test`                             | Runs the unit tests through Karma and the functional tests through a local Selenium instance
`yarn test_unit`                        | Watches the unit tests via Karma
`yarn test_functional`                  | Runs the functional tests through a local Selenium instance (requires app running on localhost:5000)
`yarn test_functional_sauce`            | Runs the functional tests through Sauce Labs (requires app running on localhost:5000)
`yarn lint`                             | Lints the JS, reporting errors/warnings.

---

### Functional test options

The functional tests can be executed with a couple of options.

`--env=preprod` Will run the test against preprod.
`--spec=mci` Will run a single test spec (`mci.spec.js`) instead of the entire suite.
`--suite=core` Will run a suite of tests (core) instead of the entire suite.

These options can be combined with `test_functional` or `test_functional_sauce`, eg:

`yarn test_functional_sauce -- --env=preprod --spec=mci` Will run the MCI spec against preprod via SauceLabs.

*NOTE:* You will need the appropriate environment variables to be able to connect to SauceLabs.

## Deployment with elastic beanstalk

You will need to install the EB CLI tools using PIP.

*NOTE:* The EB tools do not currently work with Python 3.5.  I installed the EB CLI tools *outside* my virtual environment and installed installed them globally using the following commands

```
pyenv deactivate                 # to exit the virtual environment
sudo pip install awsebcli        # install the eb cli tools
```

Using the Elastic Beanstalk CLI is quite simple but mus tbe done *outside* the virtual environment of the project itself.  It will use the requirements.txt to ensure any requirements are at the right version for the deployed application.

Initialise the project using the command

```
eb init --region eu-west-1
```

This will launch a wizard asking for the AWS credentials and some questions about the environment to create.

`eu-west-1` is the name for Ireland.  I chose the default application name.

Once completed, you can then deploy the application using the following command:

```
eb create
```

This will create the environment and spin up the application . Once the application has deployed you can use the following command to open it in a browser

```
eb open
```

## Internationalisation

We use flask-babel to do internationalisation.  To extract messages from source, in the project root run the following command.

```
pybabel extract -F babel.cfg -o app/translations/messages.pot .
```

This will extract messages and place them in the translations/messages.pot file ready for translation.

You should only need to create the language files once.

To create Welsh language files, run the following command

```
pybabel init -i app/translations/messages.pot -d translations -l cy
```

To create the gaelic language files, use the following:

```
pybabel init -i app/translations/messages.pot -d translations -l gd
```

To compile the language files for use in the application, use the following:

```
pybabel compile -d translations
```

As strings are added to the application, you will need to update but not overwrite the translations for the various languages.
To update the language strings, use:

```
pybabel update -i app/translations/messages.pot -d translations
```

## Environment Variables

```
EQ_USER_AUTHENTICATION_RRM_PUBLIC_KEY - the RRM public key for JWT user authentication

```

## JWT Integration
Integration with the survey runner requires the use of a signed JWT using public and private key pair (see https://jwt.io,
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519, https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515).

Once signed the JWT must be encrypted using JWE (see https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7516).

The JWT payload must contain the following claims:
- exp - expiration time
- iat - issued at time

The header of the JWT must include the following:
- alg - the signing algorithm (must be RS256)
- type - the token type (must be JWT)
- kid - key identification  (must be EDCRRM)

The JOSE header of the final JWE must include:
- alg - the key encryption algorithm (must be RSA-OAEP)
- enc - the key encryption encoding (must be A256GCM)

To access the application you must provide a valid JWT. To do this browse to the /session url and append a token parameter.
This parameter must be set to a valid JWE encrypted JWT token. Only encrypted tokens are allowed.

There is a python script for generating tokens for use in development, to run:
```
python token_generator.py
```

## profiling

Setting the `EQ_PROFILING` environment variable to `True` will enable profiling of the application.  Profiling information
will be collected per-request in the `profiling` directory where it can be examined using the Pstats Interactive Browser.

`$ python -m pstats <filename>`

will load the file into the interactive browser where it can be sorted and queried as required.

## Updating / Installing dependencies

We make use of python pip's support for only installing packages if their sha-256 hash matches a known good value.
To add a new dependency, try installing the `hashin` python package that calculates a hash and adds it to the
local `requirements.txt`. When installing the dependencies, always use `--require-hashes` to force this check
on downloaded packages.
