'''
  Everything in this class and the following packages is potentially serialized to the database and
  therefore can cause issues if the code changes between deployments and sessions remain in the database.
  Hence we check the git revision that created it, and if that has changed we replay the post data to
  get back to the same state


  schema - the entire schema (once it's parsed) this is needed as repeated elements modifies the schema, so the modified
  version needs to be recovered
  questionnaire_state - the doubly linked listed, i.e. the Node object, its associated Block State and all the child
  states
